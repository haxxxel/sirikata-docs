What is Sirikata?
-----------------
Sirikata is a BSD licensed open source platform for games and virtual
worlds. We aim to provide a set of libraries and protocols which can
be used to deploy a virtual world, as well as fully featured sample
implementations of services for hosting and deploying these worlds.

What is sirikata-docs?
----------------------
This repository (sirikata-docs) contains the documentation for
Sirikata. It contains user guides for building projects on the
Sirikata platform (for instance, describing how to write scripts and
add content to a world).  It also contains developer guides for
modifying Sirikata's code or writing new plugins, for instance to fix
bugs in the system or add a new physics engine.

These are not API docs. That documentation is autogenerated from the
source code. You can autogenerate it yourself using Doxygen (see the
main repository at http://github.com/sirikata/sirikata) or you can see
the most up to date version at http://sirikata.com/docs/head/.

What tools are used and how is this repository structured?
----------------------------------------------------------
We use Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) for our documentation. To add
or modify documentation, you mainly need to understand
reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), which is
the format used for Sphinx documents. It is an intuitive format that
is readable as plaintext, so just try jumping in. Adding references
between documents, glossary items, and code examples requires learning
a bit more about Sphinx.

The root directory contains only the build files and the source/
directory, which contains all the documentation files. Once you run
Sphinx, it will also contain the build/ directory, which contains all
the generated files. Within the source/ directory, the contents should
be self-explanatory. At a high level, we currently provide a user
guide and a developer guide, as described earlier.

How do I build the documentation?
---------------------------------
The Makefile and make.bat in the root directory handle this for
you. Make sure you have Sphinx installed. Then run

  make html

to generate the html version. All generated documentation will be
placed in the directory build/.  The argument 'html' can be
substituted with other generators, e.g., dirhtml, latex, or htmlhelp.
