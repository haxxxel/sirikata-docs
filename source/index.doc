What is Sirikata?
-----------------

Sirikata is an BSD licensed open source platform for games and virtual
worlds. We aim to provide a set of libraries and protocols which can
be used to deploy a virtual world, as well as fully featured sample
implementations of services for hosting and deploying these worlds.

Sirikata is not an application but a platform on which shared,
networked, 3D applications can be built.  Examples include multiplayer
online games, interactive meeting spaces, and social virtual worlds.
Sirikata recognizes that large parts of these systems are identical --
objects join a shared space, discover other objects, communicate with
each other, have behavior defined by small scripts, and so on -- and
attempts to provide scalable, flexible, and extensible implementations
of these services.  Application developers can build on Sirikata's
infrastructure, taking advantage of a much lower barrier to entry and
proven scalability.

Target Audience
---------------

This manual is targeted at *users* of Sirikata.  Note that this
means users of the platform, not users of applications built on
Sirikata.  So in this case, user means an application developer.
Because Sirikata has many standard components with reasonable
defaults, ideally applications can be developed mainly in scripting
languages.  However, this manual is geared towards users who need to
also extend Sirikata, adding functionality which is not already
available from the existing plugins.
