Emerson Tutorials
=================

The best way to get started is to jump right in and write a simple
script. The first few tutorials step through the necessary basics:
connecting to the world, writing a simple script, controlling an
object, and communicating with other objects. Everyone should start by
working through these tutorials in order.  After these, follow
additional tutorials or just experiment, using the
:ref:`emerson-lang-ref` for additional details.
