Watched
=======================================

High level description
--------
Watched objects are created through a call to the :ref:`util` util
object.  They can be passed to :ref:`when` whens to create scripter-defined
events.  When any field in a watched object is set, the entire object
is flagged as dirty.  Scripts in Emerson are event-driven.  When a
callback associated with an event is finished running, the system runs
through the when predicates of all watched objects that were flagged.
If the predicate previously evaluated to false, but switches to true,
the callback of the when is executed.
