Util object
=======================================

High level description
--------
The util object provides basic math functions (sin, cos, rand, etc.)
and an interface to create watched and when variables.  The util
object is available regardless of whether code is being executed
within a context or without.



Notes:
--------
The util object may undergo a name change.
The basic distinction between util and system is that util's functions
should be available to a scripter regardless of what context his/her
code runs in.
