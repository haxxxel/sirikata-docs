Communicating with Other Entities
=================================

The primary way that a presence associated with one entity interacts
with a presence associated with another entity is for the presences to
send messages between each other.  This tutorial will show you how to
send and receive messages between presences.

In the real world, if you were going to email your friend, you would
first need your friend's email address.  Similarly, before Presence A
can send a message to Presence B in the virtual world, Presence A must
be have Presence A's "address".  This tutorial will first describe how
to get a presence's address, then it will explain how to send
messages, and, finally, it will describe how to receive messages.  It
will use the example of one presence's sending another presence a
request to move, and the other presence's responding to that message
by moving.


Register proximity queries/discover presences
--------

Theory
+++++++++++++++++++
By default an entity only knows about its own presences.  For an
entity to discover other presences in the virtual world, it registers
a query through one of its presences with the Meru system.  Here's an
example of such a query:
::
        system.presences[0].onProxAdded( userAddedCallback );
        system.presences[0].setQueryAngle(.4);

These queries take a little thinking about.  Roughly translated, the
first line of the above code reads: "When a presence gets near to be
important to me, execute the function ``userAddedCallback``, which the
scripter has defined somewhere earlier in the program."  (We will
show an example of ``userAddedCallback`` that sends messages in the
next section.)

The second line of the above code actually defines what it means to be
"important".  Meru uses the amount of Presence A's field of view taken
up by Presence B as a measure of B's importance to A.  Maybe a more
concrete way to think about the above is through pixels.  If Presence
B takes a large number of pixels on a computer monitor showing
Presence A's view of the world, it is more important than if it takes
only a small number of pixels to render B.  In this way, presences
that are nearer to A or larger are more important to A than those that
are more distant and smaller.  The below figures highlight relative
importance.  The lower figures are more "important" than the upper figures.

   .. image:: images/relativeImportanceFigures/leastImportant.png
      :width: 50%
The bug in the above picture is less "important" than the bug in the
picture below.

   .. image:: images/relativeImportanceFigures/neutral.png
      :width: 50%
The bug in the above picture is less "important" than the bug in the
picture below.

   .. image:: images/relativeImportanceFigures/mostImportant.png
      :width: 50%
The bug in the above figure would be more "important" than the bugs in
either of the previous two figures.

However, because of discretization and other errors caused by pixels,
we don't use pixels directly.  Instead we use steradians.  The second
line of the above code therefore reads, "A presence is important to me
if it takes up at least .4 steradians of my field of view".
(steradians are a measure of solid angle.  You can read more about
them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian.
All we really want you to know is that a large steradian
means that a presence would take up many pixels on your monitor; a
small steradian would take up very few pixels on your monitor.)

Before moving on to the next section, it should be noted that in
addition to the ``onProxAdded`` function shown above, Emerson has a
complementary ``onProxRemoved`` function for presences.  It looks
something like this in practice:
::
        system.presences[0].onProxRemoved(userRemovedCallback);

Essentially, when an external presence no longer satisfies a solid
angle query, the system notifies you that that presence has left the
result set by calling userRemoveCallback.

Try it yourself
+++++++++++++++++++
Enter the virtual world as an avatar.  You should have just one
presence associated that is connected to the space.  From here, script
yourself.  Enter the following code into your own scripting terminal
(hit ``ctrl`` + ``s`` to bring up a scripting window for yourself):
::
        function userAddedCallback(nowImportantPresence)
        {
            system.print("\n\nPresence with address " + nowImportantPresence.toString() + " is now important!\n\n");
        }

        function userRemovedCallback(nowUnimportantPresence)
        {
            system.print("\n\nPresence with address " + nowUnimportantPresence.toString() + " is now unimportant!\n\n");
        }

        system.presences[0].onProxAdded( userAddedCallback );
        system.presences[0].setQueryAngle(.4);

Now, move closer and farther from other presences in the virtual
world.  You should see the print message associated with
``userAddedCallback`` when you get very close to an presence, and you
should see ``userRemovedCallback`` when you move away from that
presence after being more distant.

You can monkey around by changing ``userAddedCallback`` and
``userRemovedCallback`` to do more elaborate things, for instance,
rotating your avatar in a circle on each message.



Send message
--------
The previous section should have explained to you how to discover
presences in the virtual world.  However, even if you know the
address and existence of a presence how can you interact with it?

The way that presences on distinct entities interact in Emerson is
through *messages*.  This section explains how a scripter would
create and send a message to another presence.  To do so, let's start
by re-using a little code from the previous section:
::
        function userAddedCallback(nowImportantPresence)
        {
           system.print("\n\nPresence with address " + nowImportantPresence.toString() + " is now important!\n\n");
           ...
           We will be changing the contents of this function.
           ...
        }

        function userRemovedCallback(nowUnimporantPresence)
        {
            system.print("\n\nPresence with address " + nowUnimportantPresence.toString() + " is now unimportant!\n\n");
        }

        system.presences[0].onProxAdded( userAddedCallback );
        system.presences[0].setQueryAngle(.4);


As mentioned in the previous section, the Emerson runtime system will
automatically execute ``userAddedCallback`` when a new presence
consumes more than .4 steradians of ``presence[0]``'s field of view.
What we didn't mention before was what the runtime binds to ``nowImportantPresence`` (the
argument of ``userAddedCallback``) how it can be used.
``nowImportantPresence`` corresponds to an Emerson *visible* object.

To simplify sending messages, Emerson provides "arrow" syntax below.
::
        function userAddedCallback(nowImportantPresence)
        {
           system.print("\n\nPresence with address " + nowImportantPresence.toString() + " is now important!\n\n");

           //create a new message
           var moveMsg = new Object();
           moveMsg.action = "forward";

           moveMsg -> nowImportantPresence;
        }

The line ``moveMsg -> nowImportantPresence``, handles
message-sending, where the variable to the left of the arrow is
an Emerson object, and the variable to the right of the arrow is the
intended recipient of the message.  That's all there is to it.  You
can now send messages.  The next section will describe how to react to
messages that you receive.



Receive Message
--------

In general, a scripter may want to perform different actions depending
on the type of message that his/her presence receives and who that
message is from.  

Emerson provides custom "arrow" syntax to make this process easier.

For instance, examine the following code snippet:
::
        function actionMsgCallback(msg,sender)
        {
            system.print("I got a message with action: " + msg.action);
        }

        actionMsgCallback <- [{'action'::}];

In English, the last line of the above code states, "If any presence
connected to this entity receives a message that has a field entitled
action in it, then call the function actionMsgCallback."

One can also create more elaborate patterns for matching.  For instance,
::
        actionMsgCallback <- [{'action'::}] <-   someSender;
        
the above line of code transalates to "Call actionMsgCallback if any
of my presences receive a message from someSender that has an action
field."
::
        actionMsgCallback <- [{'action':'forward':}] <-   someSender;

And the above line of code transalates to "Call actionMsgCallback if any
of my presences receive a message from someSender that has an action
field that has the value 'forward'."
::
        actionMsgCallback <- [{'action':'forward':},
                              {'seqno':3:}]   <-
                              someSender;

And the above line of code translates to "Call actionMsgCallback if any
of my presences receive a message from someSender that has an action
field that has the value 'forward' *and* has a field named 'seqno'
with value 3."

To match any message, with any fields, scripters currently, must enter:
::
        actionMsgCallback <- [new util.Pattern()]  <-
                              someSender;

This is because of a compiler bug, which will be fixed in the next
released version of the code.
