Presence object
=======================================

High level description
--------

A presence object encapsulates the physical and logical representation
of an entity.  (An entity however may have more than one presence.)

Through a presence object, an entity interacts directly with the space
interacting with the space.  These interactions include, requesting
the space to move the presence's representation, change the mesh
associated with the presence's representation, receive callbacks from
system events (eg when new exterior presences satisfy a presence's
proximity queries), send messages, etc.


Presence object methods
--------
An incomplete overview of functionality provided through presence objects:



  * getMesh and setMesh: get the uri or set the uri associated with
    the representation of the presence in the virtual world.
  * setQueryAngle: Takes a single numeric argument.  Any presence that
    would take up a larger solid angle than this argument will be
    returned to your presence from PINTO.  (See associated onProxAdded
    and onProxRemoved function below.)
  * onProxAdded and onProxRemoved: Each take a single function
    argument.  This function is called when a presence in the virtual
    world satisfies or no longer satisfies the query angle a scripter
    has specified, respectively.
  * getVelocity and setVelocity: set the velocity associated with this
    presence.  getVelocity returns a vec3 and setVelocity takes a vec3 arg.
  * getPosition, setPosition, getOrientation, setOrientation,
    getOrientationVel, setOrientationVel are also provided
    


Notes:
--------
Serialization.
The syntax of each of the above functions will likely change.
