Introduction for Application Developers
=======================================

Welcome to the application developer's guide. If you want to connect
to a Sirikata world and script objects, this is where you should
start.

Currently, the primary scripting language for Sirikata worlds is
**Emerson**, a derivative of JavaScript with features designed
specifically for virtual worlds. This guide will teach you how to
connect to a Sirikata world and script objects in Emerson.

Navigating the Guide
--------------------

This guide is broken down into two major components:
:ref:`emerson-tutorials` and the `Emerson api
<http://sirikata.com/docs/head/emersonapi/>`_.  The tutorials will get
you started, letting you start writing code with no previous
experience with the system.  The language reference is useful once you
know your way around the system but need to know specifics -- what is
the exact syntax and options for sending messages? or how do I
dynamically create new objects?

For a beginner, we recommend starting with the
:ref:`emerson-introductory-tutorials`
to get a feel for how the system works. Then, to better understand
the system and the language, learn the
:ref:`terminology` used throughout this documentation, as well as
basic JavaScript syntax, most of which Emerson borrows directly
(e.g. expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, object and array
literals; some good references, ignoring web-specific features such
as DOM access, are
these `tutorials <http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/bridge/1998/res/javascript/javascript-tutorial.html>`_
and a description of how to use `classical inheritance <http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html>`_)

At that point, you should be familiar enough to start writing your
own, novel applications. Of course, through additional tutorials and the
language reference, you can learn about more features of Emerson and
the system.

If you get stuck or are unable to find the answer to a
question in these guides, try the `emerson-users mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/emerson-users>`_.  Be sure to search
before posting a new question.
