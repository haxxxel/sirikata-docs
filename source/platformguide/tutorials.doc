Platform Development Tutorials
==============================

The sheer size of complexity of the Sirikata code can be a real
barrier to contributing. The other parts of the guide try to
help a new developer isolate themselves to a smaller portion of the
code, allowing them to quickly understand the components they need to
modify or extend. Here, we try to address a number of common tasks
that span the entire project, either because they deal with utility
code used throughout the project or because they deal with the
architecture of the entire system.
